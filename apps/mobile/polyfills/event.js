/**
 * EventTarget / Event / CustomEvent globals for Hermes.
 *
 * libp2p (and its dependencies) rely on these Web APIs at import time.
 *
 * Uses the `event-target-polyfill` npm package for EventTarget + Event — it
 * is more spec-complete than a hand-rolled minimal class (handles `once`,
 * capture options, and AbortSignal-based listener removal correctly).  The
 * package does not include CustomEvent, which libp2p's `safeDispatchEvent`
 * uses internally, so we add a minimal shim for it on top.
